This is my master's thesis in the field of Computer Science at the Faculty of Computer Science at AGH. In it, I check how physics informed neural networks (PINNs) work in solving differential equations and how they maintain their invariants.

The best example is the Lotka-Volterra equation (predator-prey model), where adding an appropriate component to the loss function (Help loss) compared to numerical methods with a time step of h=0.001 gives very good results. You can see this in the charts below.
